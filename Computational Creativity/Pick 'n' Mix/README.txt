
1.There are  2 corpora sources I use in this bot : "Netflix Movie Categories",
 and  "A list of musical genres taken from wikipedia article titles."

2. I integrated these 2 corpora sources in the outputs of my bot using 
"Netflix may use more #genres# music as #categories# movie's background music."

3. My aim of this bot is to provide the idea of combining different types of movie categories and music genres.
 At many times, when the rarely used music is the background music of a certain type of movie, the result will be amazingly suitable and surprising.
